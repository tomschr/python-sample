# Python Sample Project

Each directory contains a Python project, from the simplest
to a more complex version.

* `01/`: only a simple `setup.py`, README.md, and LICENSE
* `02/`: additional `requirements.txt`
* '03/`: read `requirements.txt` file with `requires()` 
* `04/`: use MANIFEST.in to add `data/` files
